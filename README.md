# WIP!

This project is a WIP! Don't expect anything up to this point!

# About this repository

This repository only contains the source code of "AziÃ«lla's Babbling Bubbles", no assets whatsoever. The game has been written for the [Bubble Engine](https://github.com/jpbubble), which is a Lua based engine with built-in [NIL](https://github.com/jpbubble/NIL-isn-t-Lua) support, and NIL is also the language in which most of the code of this game has been written.
Since this is the first big project written with NIL, I don't expect github.com to support syntax highlighting for it any time soon, and if it's possible to propose it somewhere, it's all nice and cool, but the the present time I 
must place my priorities elsewhere.

Information about the game itself, will be posted later!
